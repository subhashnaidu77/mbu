2. Finding Merge Point of Two Singly Linked Lists
Problem:
Given two singly linked lists that merge at some node, find the node where they merge.
 Real-Time Example:
•	Railway tracks merging at a point.
•	Tracking version histories in Git — two branches may merge at a commit.
 Approach:
1.	Find lengths of both lists.
2.	Move the pointer of longer list by the difference in lengths.
3.	Traverse both lists together until a common node is found.
